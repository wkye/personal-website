This the code source for my [personal website](williamkye.com). The website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/). Additionally most of my blog post are written entirely in a jupter notebook then converted into an markdown file using [nb_hugo_convert](https://github.com/jbandlow/nb_hugo_exporter).
