As I have worked in several startups (each subsequent company tends to get smaller :eyes:), I've picked up a scrappy mindset where I love learning new things. And fortunately, these smaller starts up offer the latitude to fail quickly and learn (more?) quickly!\n",

    "- [Ethan Rosenthal](https://github.com/EthanRosenthal/website-source): My former MLE lead at Dia&Co! Built a lot of my stuff on top of the code he had already written. Was a huge help in quickly debugging my site.\n",
    "- [Lugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I&t=1092s): My initial testing of Hugo was helped by this tutorial.\n",

    "# Getting Started: Hugo\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm assuming that you have some knowledge of python and git but this is your first foray into hugo and netlify. Let's start with what [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hugo is built up on Go, making it super fast and responsive. It's abstracted out enough from Go to make it simple for people who don't build websites for a living (like me) but at the same time highly extensible. First install hugo on to your machine:\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install hugo\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you have hugo installed, go to whatever base directory you work out of and run the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "hugo new site personal-website\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a new folder titled `personal-website` with this directory tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "personal-website\n",
    "├── archetypes\n",
    "│   └── default.md\n",
    "├── config.toml\n",
    "├── content\n",
    "├── data\n",
    "├── layouts\n",
    "├── public\n",
    "├── static\n",
    "└── themes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of keeping this tutorial succinct, the main folders you will utilize will be:\n",
    "- `config.toml` - Basic configuration file. Controls things like what language your site will render in or whether to enable emojis (obviously you should enable, duh :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).\n",
    "- `content` - The content in markdown form on your website.\n",
    "- `static` - All of your non-dynamic files (e.g. images, css, etc).\n",
    "- `themes` - The template for how your site will be displayed. There are a multitude of [themes to choose from on Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/)!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started: Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry is a package dependency tool. It will allow you to create a virtual environment that mimics the one I am currently in, and thus allows you to reproduce any work that I do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed poetry, initialize poetry within your `personal-website` folder and it should create a `pyproject.toml` Within your `pyproject.toml` file, copy the contents of my [pyproject.toml file](https://github.com/wkye/personal-website/blob/main/pyproject.toml). Then run `poetry install` and SHAZAAM! This should create a `poetry.lock` file and now your machine should more or less function the same as mine :smiley::\n",
    "```\n",
    "# install poetry\n",
    "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n",
    "# initialize poetry within your project\n",
    "poetry init\n",
    "# After copying my poetry.lock file, this should install all my packages onto your machine\n",
    "poetry install\n",

    "\n",
    "# Getting Started: Netlify\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugo pairs nicely with Netlify. Hugo is a great service to build your website, but you need Netlify to deploy your app. There is already great documentation on [pairing the two](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/), so I won't go into great detail. But basically just create an account on netlify and connect it to your GitHub repo. Make sure you create a `netlify.toml` file and you copy and past the contents of my [netlify.toml file](https://github.com/wkye/personal-website/blob/main/netlify.toml).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting up your home page\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to building your website is to choose your theme. I went with [hugo-theme-mini](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini) because I felt it was simplistic and met the purposes of my website. Copy the contents of the repo into your `themes` folder (Note, I had to make some small tweaks to my theme, so mine may not exactly match yours)\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini themes/hugo-theme-mini/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you chose and obtained your theme, update your `theme` variable within you `config.toml` file to reflect the folder that houses your theme. Your config should look something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "baseURL = 'yourwebsitename'\n",
    "languageCode = 'en-us'\n",
    "title = 'My New Hugo Site'\n",
    "theme = 'hugo-theme-mini'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you run `hugo server`, your website will compile locally and you taken the first step towards building your website :tada:. Just type in the localhost number produced into your browser. In this case `//localhost:52500/`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "hugo server\n",

    "# Customizing your home page\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now building your website from scratch, so the customization are endless. But for the purposes of this tutorial we're gonna stick closely to the template and just make some basic changes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's start with the basic of how pages are constructed. Within the `layouts` directory are the basic HTML templates; each file determines how aspects of your page will look. The HTML code that produces the title and summary for your homepage is in [layouts/index.html](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/blob/master/layouts/index.html#L8).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The parameters `Title` and `Params.Bio` are the variables that the HTML file is using to build your site.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<h1>{{ .Site.Title }}</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ with .Site.Params.Bio }}\n",
    "  <h2>{{ . | markdownify }}</h2>\n",
    "{{ end }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can change the title and bio of your website by updating the variable in `config.toml` file. It should look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "baseURL = 'yourwebsitename'\n",
    "languageCode = 'en-us'\n",
    "title = 'MY AWESOME NEW WEBSITE'\n",
    "theme = 'hugo-theme-mini'\n",
    "\n",
    "[params]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that produces the image on your home page is also in[layouts/partials/profile.html](https://github.com/wkye/personal-website/blob/main/themes/hugo-theme-mini/layouts/partials/profile.html#L10)\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "The static directory is where you store the images you want to you. This particular code is looking for a file name `avatar.png` within the directory `static/images/`. So lets initialize this folder structure then download this [sample image from my github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkye/personal-website/main/static/images/personal-website/sample_avatar.png) and copy it to your new `/static/images/` directory.    \n",
    "```\n",
    "# make a new images directory under static\n",
    "mkdir static/images/\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, I want to add an about page. To do so, we need to leverage the `content` folder. In Hugo, content is where you put your markdown files, which are the pages of your website. Hugo will generate an HTML file and create a new web directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [layouts/partials/navigation.html](https://github.com/wkye/personal-website/blob/main/themes/hugo-theme-mini/layouts/partials/navigation.html#L7) is where we see the `about` tag referenced in the navigation\n",
